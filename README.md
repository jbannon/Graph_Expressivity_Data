# Graph Expressivity Data


A collection of data sets for the analysis of the expressivity of graph feature transforms (e.g. kernels, graph neural networks). Collated from the [BREC repository](https://github.com/GraphPKU/BREC/tree/Release) and David McKay's [combinatorial graph collection](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html).
